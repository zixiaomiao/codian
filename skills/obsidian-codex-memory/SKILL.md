# Obsidian Codex Memory

Use this skill when the user says any of:

- 启用 Obsidian 记忆
- 先读我的 Obsidian
- 同步 Obsidian 记忆
- 更新 Codex 会话总结
- 用我的 Obsidian 记忆继续
- read Obsidian memory
- update Codex memory

## Vault and configuration

The memory script supports any computer. It resolves the vault in this order:

- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` environment variable
- saved config from `obsidian_memory.py init --vault <path>`
- common Obsidian vault locations

If no vault can be found, ask the user for their Obsidian vault path and run:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py init --vault "<path-to-vault>"
```

## Workflow

1. At the start of any task, read token-saving memory before doing substantial work. Default reading should prioritize `Codex/project-summary.md` when present, then load startup rules, reading strategy, indexes, fixed paths, and any history blocks explicitly matched by query keywords:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read
```

Refresh the project summary after substantial project-memory changes:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py project-summary
```

Refresh categorized memory files after substantial memory changes:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py memory-categories
```

For Obsidian, GitHub, sync, plugin, memory, or retrospective tasks, pass task keywords and read only 1-3 matching history blocks:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read --query "obsidian sync git/github"
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read --query "codex/plugin obsidian-codex-memory"
```

Use the installed plugin root if it is not installed in `~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory`.

2. Finish the user's actual task.

3. After the task is complete, append a compact summary only if the user asks to update memory, or the work creates a durable preference, path, fix, or operating rule:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py append --summary "<5 lines max>"
```

Keep summaries short. Record only durable paths, preferences, conclusions, pitfalls, and verified fixes.

4. For selective GitHub sync of memory files:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py sync-github --dry-run
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py sync-github
```

## Rules

- Do not record API keys, passwords, tokens, or private credentials.
- Do not dump the entire memory note unless the user asks for full memory.
- Prefer `Codex/project-summary.md` for project orientation before reading detailed history.
- Use `Codex/memory/Project.md`, `Decision.md`, `Todo.md`, `Bug.md`, and `User-Preference.md` for precise category reads when relevant.
- For ordinary tasks, use startup memory only. For specialized tasks, query matching history blocks by keywords.
- Complete the user's task before writing a memory summary.
- Keep new summaries within 5 lines when possible.
- Prefer UTF-8 direct file writes. Avoid shell pipelines that can corrupt Chinese text.
- For GitHub sync, only Codex memory files should be staged and committed. Do not treat this plugin as a full Obsidian vault manager.
