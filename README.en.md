# Obsidian Codex Memory

[中文说明](README.md)

Use an Obsidian vault as long-term memory for Codex.

This is a **Codex plugin**, not an Obsidian community plugin. It lets Codex read a compact memory note, append session summaries, and optionally sync the memory note through a Git-backed Obsidian vault.

## What it does

- Reads `Codex/Codex 会话总结.md` from your Obsidian vault.
- Creates a generic startup memory template during initialization when the memory note is missing.
- Reads only startup rules, reading strategy, indexes, and fixed paths by default instead of expanding full history.
- Retrieves 1-3 relevant history blocks by keyword to save tokens.
- Appends compact Codex session summaries.
- Supports any vault path through `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` or a saved local config.
- Can selectively sync Codex memory files to GitHub.
- Avoids recording credentials or secrets by design; you should still review summaries before syncing sensitive work.

## One-line install

macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixiaomiao/obsidian-codex-memory/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixiaomiao/obsidian-codex-memory/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then configure your vault:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py init --vault "/path/to/your/Obsidian vault"
```

On Windows:

```powershell
python "$env:USERPROFILE\plugins\obsidian-codex-memory\scripts\obsidian_memory.py" init --vault "D:\path\to\your\Obsidian vault"
```

You can also skip local config and set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` in your shell environment.

## Usage

Read compact memory:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read
```

Read relevant history by keywords, up to 3 blocks by default:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read --query "obsidian sync git/github"
```

Read the full memory note:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read --full
```

Append a summary:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py append --summary "5-8 lines of durable session memory"
```

Preview GitHub sync:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py sync-github --dry-run
```

Run GitHub sync:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py sync-github
```

## Expected Obsidian note

The default memory note is:

```text
Codex/Codex 会话总结.md
```

Inside the vault, this means:

```text
<your-vault>/Codex/Codex 会话总结.md
```

You can change it when initializing:

```bash
python3 ~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory/scripts/obsidian_memory.py init --vault "/path/to/vault" --memory-rel "Codex/My Memory.md"
```

If the note does not exist, `init` creates a generic template with:

- Startup rules
- Reading strategy
- Task retrieval index
- Fixed path index
- History archive notes
- Session logs

The template does not hard-code another user's local paths. It records the current computer's configured vault path.

## Token-saving strategy

The plugin defaults to this reading logic:

- Ordinary tasks: read only startup rules and the current user message.
- Obsidian/GitHub/sync tasks: also query `obsidian`, `sync`, `git/github`, `github-sync`, and similar terms.
- Plugin/memory tasks: also query `codex/plugin`, `codex/memory`, `obsidian-codex-memory`, and similar terms.
- Retrospectives: read only 1-3 matched history blocks.
- Never expand the whole session summary unless explicitly requested.

## Token and cache impact

For a session summary around 18,000 characters, reading the full file may cost roughly 9k-16k tokens. With this plugin, the default startup read is usually around 1k-2k tokens; adding 1-3 keyword-matched history blocks is usually around 2k-4k tokens.

| Scenario | Read content | Estimated tokens | Compared with full read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| No memory read | No long-term memory | 0 | Cheapest, but no memory benefit |
| Default plugin read | Startup rules, reading strategy, indexes, fixed paths | About 1k-2k | Saves about 80%-90% |
| Plugin + keyword search | Default read + 1-3 relevant history blocks | About 2k-4k | Saves about 65%-85% |
| Full session summary read | Entire memory file | About 9k-16k | Baseline |

Cache-wise, the default startup sections are stable and are more likely to be reused. Keyword matches vary by task, so their cache hit rate is more moderate. Full reads contain stable parts too, but ongoing log appends and larger payloads can reduce practical cache benefit.

In short: this is not meant to compete with reading no memory at all. It reduces the cost of long-term memory from tens of thousands of tokens to a few thousand while preserving useful context.

## How installation works

The install scripts:

- clone or update this repository into `~/plugins/obsidian-codex-memory`
- create or update `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
- register the plugin as available in Codex

After installation, open Codex and enable **Obsidian Codex Memory** from the personal marketplace.

## GitHub sync behavior

`sync-github` is intentionally conservative.

- Allowed local-over-remote memory files:
  - `Codex/Codex 会话总结.md`
  - `Codex/MACOS_CODEX_OBSIDIAN_MEMORY.md`
- The plugin is focused on Codex memory files. It is not a full Obsidian vault manager.
- The vault must already be a Git repository with `origin` configured.

Always run `sync-github --dry-run` before real sync when using a new vault.

## Requirements

- Codex desktop or Codex environment with plugin support
- Python 3
- Git, if using one-line install or GitHub sync
- Obsidian vault on local disk
