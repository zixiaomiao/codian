[中文](README.md)

Use an Obsidian vault as Codex long-term memory.

This is a **Codex plugin**, not an Obsidian community plugin. It reads and writes the new structured Codex memory vault layout: entry files, context, memory, logs, workflows, and archive.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for planned improvements.

## Current Layout

Default Codex memory vault layout:

```text
codian/
  README.md
  AGENTS.md
  00-入口/
  10-Context-上下文/
    project-summary.md
    fixed-path-index.md
  20-Memory-记忆/
    project.md
    decisions.md
    todos.md
    bugs-and-fixes.md
    user-preferences.md
    lessons.md
  30-Logs-日志/
    codex-session-summary.md
  40-Workflows-工作流/
    codex-memory-workflow.md
  90-Archive-归档/
```

On first use, the plugin asks the user for the Obsidian vault path and saves the choice locally. If the selected path is inside the iCloud Obsidian container, the plugin normalizes it to the container `Documents` root and creates `Codian Memory/` there. All later Codian memory files are written under that independent directory, not inside a nested vault.

## Features

- Reads `codian/README.md` and `codian/AGENTS.md` first, then `codian/10-Context-上下文/project-summary.md`.
- Reads `codian/30-Logs-日志/codex-session-summary.md` as the full session log.
- Generates categorized memory files under `codian/20-Memory-记忆/`.
- Creates the `codian/` directory, the new subdirectory layout, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and workflow files during init.
- Compact reads prioritize the project summary, then matching categories, startup rules, and a few matched history entries.
- Supports keyword lookup for 1-3 relevant historical log blocks.
- Appends compact Codex session summaries.
- Supports any local Obsidian vault through `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` or local config.
- Avoids recording API keys, passwords, tokens, and other secrets by default.

## Install

Copy the command below into Codex or your terminal. No double-click installer is required.

macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixiaomiao/codian/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zixiaomiao/codian/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

On first use, the script asks for your Obsidian vault path. You can also run this manually:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/Codian/scripts/obsidian_memory.py init --vault "/path/to/your/Obsidian vault"
```

Windows:

```powershell
python "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\Codian\scripts\obsidian_memory.py" init --vault "D:\path\to\your\Obsidian vault"
```

You may also set `OBSIDIAN_VAULT` instead of writing local config.

## Usage

Read compact memory:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/Codian/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read
```

Generate or refresh the project summary:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/Codian/scripts/obsidian_memory.py project-summary
```

Generate or refresh categorized memory:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/Codian/scripts/obsidian_memory.py memory-categories
```

Read matched history, up to 3 blocks by default:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/Codian/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read --query "obsidian memory plugin"
```

Read the full memory log:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/Codian/scripts/obsidian_memory.py read --full
```

Append a summary:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/Codian/scripts/obsidian_memory.py append --summary "5-8 lines of durable session memory"
```

## Token Saving Strategy

- Ordinary tasks: read `codian/README.md`, `codian/AGENTS.md`, and `codian/10-Context-上下文/project-summary.md` first, then startup rules and the current user message.
- Category tasks: read matching files under `codian/20-Memory-记忆/` by keyword.
- Obsidian/memory tasks: search for `obsidian`, `vault-structure`, `codian`.
- Plugin/memory tasks: search for `codex/plugin`, `codex/memory`, `codian`.
- Historical review: include only 1-3 matched log blocks.
- Do not expand the full session log unless explicitly requested.

## Requirements

- Codex desktop app, or another Codex environment with plugin support
- Python 3
- A local Obsidian vault

## What the install command does

- Syncs the full repository into `~/.codex/skills/Codian GitHub`.
- Syncs the required runtime files into `~/.codex/skills/Codian`.
- Registers Codian in the Codex personal marketplace.

After installation, Codex reads the plugin directly from `~/.codex/skills/Codian`, and the root-level `SKILL.md` is the skill definition. The `~/.codex/skills/Codian GitHub` folder keeps the repository and release assets.
